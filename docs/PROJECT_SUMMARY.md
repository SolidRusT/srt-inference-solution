# AWS EC2 Inference Solution - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The AWS EC2 Inference Solution is a comprehensive, Terraform-based infrastructure as code solution for deploying containerized inference applications on AWS. It was developed to provide a reliable, repeatable, and maintainable approach to deploying inference services using Docker containers on EC2 instances.

## Key Features

- **Fully Automated Deployment**: Complete infrastructure provisioning with a single `terraform apply` command
- **Docker-Based Architecture**: Containerized application deployment for consistency and portability
- **Automated Updates**: EC2 instance automatically pulls new Docker images as they become available
- **Simple API Implementation**: Includes a working "Hello World" API that can be customized for real inference needs
- **DNS Integration**: Automatic Route53 record creation for user-friendly access
- **Security Best Practices**: Follows AWS best practices for secure infrastructure deployment
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation for architecture, operations, customization, and development

## Development History

The project was initiated in March 2025 as a solution for deploying inference services in a more automated and maintainable way than existing approaches. Key development milestones include:

1. **Initial Architecture Design**: Created a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. **Core Infrastructure Modules**: Developed VPC, EC2, ECR, and Route53 modules
3. **Application Integration**: Created a sample Node.js API and Dockerfile
4. **Build Pipeline**: Implemented automatic Docker image building and ECR deployment
5. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for all aspects of the solution

## Current Status

The solution is currently in a functional MVP state with all core features implemented. It provides a solid foundation for deploying inference applications, with a roadmap for enhancements including high availability, improved security, and advanced monitoring.

## Project Structure

The solution follows a modular structure:

- **Core Terraform Configuration**: Main configuration files in the root directory
- **Terraform Modules**: Modular components in the `modules/` directory
- **Application Code**: Sample application in the `app/` directory
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation in the `docs/` directory

## Development Environment

The project was developed using the following tools and technologies:

- **Infrastructure**: AWS (EC2, ECR, VPC, Route53)
- **IaC**: Terraform 1.7+
- **Container Technology**: Docker
- **Sample Application**: Node.js/Express
- **Version Control**: Git

## Future Development

Future development plans are detailed in the [Development Roadmap](./DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md), with key focus areas including:

1. **High Availability**: Moving from single instance to auto-scaling group and load balancer
2. **Enhanced Security**: Adding HTTPS, WAF, and more granular IAM permissions
3. **Monitoring and Logging**: Implementing comprehensive monitoring and alerting
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Enhancing the build and deployment pipeline
